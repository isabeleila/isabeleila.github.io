        <h5>AvengHERS, Fall 2024 Semester</h5>
        <p>Worked in an agile team of 5 memebers to create a local multiplayer platformer game based on Avenger characters using Java. There is an easter egg in the game that was created where the Avenger character you select will have a ponytail to represent HER in the AvengHERS. During the project I was mainly in the role of programming the projectiles and making sure that the mechanics of the charcters taking damage was actually wokring. During the project there was some difficulty with conflicts in our code when merging to github as many of us were unfamiliar with using GitHub; however, we were able to get past that and create an amazing platformer game.</p>

        <h5>Barbershop Simulator, Spring 2024 Semester</h5>
        <p>Created a Java code that simulates the wait times in a barbershop by using a circular queue. The program reads through a list of people that are there for a haircut, checks if there is an open chair and if there is allows the next person to sit, but if not then they are added to the wait until the time for the person in the barberchair is up.</p>
